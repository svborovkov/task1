# task1
Hi!
instruction:
1. Download files.
2. Import sql file to your database.
3. Put all other files to directory of web server.
4. Correct DB access info in check.php.
5. Open index.html in your browser and have fun ;-)

I started copy of the solution here: http://sbor.noip.me/task1/

I think there are a lot of things to do - check for incorrect user input, incorrect requests and so on. I just made main task. Css would be better, i know.
